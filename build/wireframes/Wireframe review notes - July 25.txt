Wireframe

I'd like to walk through the wireframe and test it against some high-level objectives:

1) Does it make all the key points?

2) Is the logic flow effective or persuasive?

3) Think about timeline. 
   Can we squeeze water in August, push broadband later into early September?

What should the process be for this over the next few weeks - Elizabeth
Realistic about the date

Is availability section too robust -- remove map...

Don't even worry about it... if you're not in rural america, don't even worry about...

Income and education are the primary correlates... Do we say that this isn't really about race. Make a little more prominent. Pop-up about race... link to methodological appendix.

Collapse the city v suburb chart into the map -- leaning in favor of not using the city v suburb chart. Add option to scale dots.

Get the combined ranks somewhere in there... Figure out where... overlay on maps 

local, state, federal buckets

schedule next week
